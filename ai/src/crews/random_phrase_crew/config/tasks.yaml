    Create a short phrase in English using the provided words: {words}

    Target language: {target_language}
    User context: {user_context}

    Your task:
    1. Compose a concise English phrase that incorporates as many of the provided words as possible while maintaining natural flow and meaning
    2. If target_language is provided and is not "None" or "null", translate the phrase to that target language
    3. Consider user context to make the phrase more relevant and personalized
    4. It's acceptable to skip words that don't fit naturally

    Prioritize creating something that sounds authentic and meaningful rather than forcing all words together awkwardly.

    If target_language is null, "none", or "None", only provide the English phrase.
    Otherwise, provide both the English phrase and its translation.

    You must return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    {{
      "phrase": "English phrase here",
      "phrase_target_lang": "translation in target language or null",
      "target_language": "{target_language}",
      "words_used": ["word1", "word2", "word3"]
    }}

    Where:
    - "phrase" is the generated English phrase
    - "phrase_target_lang" is the translation in the target language, or null if no target language
    - "target_language" is the target language code (polish, belarusian, italian) or null
    - "words_used" is a list of the words from the input that you actually used in the phrase
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with four fields: "phrase" (string) containing a short phrase (5-15 words)
    that naturally incorporates words from the input, "phrase_target_lang" (string or null)
    containing the translation in the target language, "target_language" (string or null)
    containing the target language code, and "words_used" (array of strings) containing the
    list of words that were actually used in the phrase.
